Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated software. It involves writing code that can navigate through the HTML structure of a website, find the relevant data, and extract it into a usable format. Web scraping is commonly used for data collection, market research, and competitive analysis.

In this project we have used BeautifulSoup to do web scrapping and extract all data. Since we are focusing on stock market so we want to know about each and every comapny to get better results after investing. So with the help of this project we get to know about each company's market price and share values.
